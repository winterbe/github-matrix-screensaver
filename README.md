The GitHub Matrix Screensaver for Mac OSX shows a constant stream of recent commits from GitHub. It's based on my [GitHub Matrix](https://github.com/winterbe/github-matrix) webapp project and on Tom Robinsons [WebSaver](https://github.com/tlrobinson/WebSaver) project (kudos).

## Install (Mac OSX only)

* Fork or clone this project, then double click the file `Web.saver` in the project folder.
* Open the Mac OSX preferences, choose Screensaver and activate `Matrix`

Unfortunately I had to turn of the backend server because Heroku has
changed their free plans and I donâ€™t wanna risk to get into payment range.
So the screensaver does no longer work out of the box. However you could
host your own server and use the screensaver with your host. The server
code is freely available on my profile.

Cheers.

## Uninstall

Open the Mac OSX preferences, choose Screensaver, right click on `Matrix` and choose delete.
